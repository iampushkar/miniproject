# Python Mini Projects

This workspace is a collection of small Python projects intended as a learning playground. Each folder contains a simple application or script designed to help the author understand and practise different Python syntax and features.

## Current Projects

- **expense-tracker**: A command-line expense tracker that records and displays expenses in a JSON file.

## How to Use

1. Navigate into the project directory you want to explore.
2. Read the source code and experiment by running the scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
3. Feel free to modify or extend the examples as you learn new concepts.

## Goals

- Learn Python syntax and standard library features.
- Build small utilities that reinforce common programming patterns.
- Keep projects simple, readable, and fun.
